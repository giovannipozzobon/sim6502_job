# 6502 Simulator MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that exposes
the `sim6502` simulator to AI coding assistants. Supports 6502, 65C02, 65CE02, and
45GS02 (MEGA65) processor variants.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Build the simulator binary from the project root:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. Node.js 18 or later
3. Install MCP server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server && npm install
   ```

## Setup by Tool

### Claude Code (Claude CLI)

**Option A — Project-scoped** (recommended)

Copy the template and fill in your absolute path:
```bash
cp mcp-server/.mcp.json.template .mcp.json
# Edit .mcp.json and set the correct absolute path
```

`.mcp.json` in the project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "6502-simulator": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["mcp-server/server.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/6502-simulator"
    }
  }
}
```

Run `claude` from the project root — it picks up `.mcp.json` automatically.
Verify the server is loaded with `/mcp` inside the session.

**Option B — Global registration**

```bash
claude mcp add 6502-simulator node /absolute/path/to/6502-simulator/mcp-server/server.js
```

Or run the installer:
```bash
bash mcp-server/install-claude.sh
```

---

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini mcp add 6502-simulator node /absolute/path/to/6502-simulator/mcp-server/server.js
```

Or run the installer:
```bash
bash mcp-server/install-gemini.sh
```

Or manually edit `~/.gemini/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "6502-simulator": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/6502-simulator/mcp-server/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Aider

Aider does not natively support MCP. To use the simulator alongside Aider:

- Run a Claude Code or Gemini CLI session in a separate terminal for simulator
  interaction via MCP.
- Use Aider for source file editing; switch to the MCP session to assemble and run.

## When the Server Is Invoked

The MCP server starts automatically when your AI tool launches. The `sim6502` process
itself does **not** start until `load_program` is called. A single simulator process
then persists for the session; a new `load_program` call restarts it with fresh code.

### Trigger patterns

| User intent | Tools called |
|-------------|--------------|
| Run / test assembly code | `load_program` → `run_program` → `read_registers` |
| Trace execution | `load_program` → `trace_run` |
| Step through code | `load_program` → `step_instruction` × N → `read_registers` |
| Inspect memory | `read_memory` |
| Debug a crash | `read_registers` → `disassemble` → `step_back` |
| Patch a byte | `write_memory` |
| Switch processor | `set_processor` |
| Set breakpoint and run | `set_breakpoint` → `run_program` → `read_registers` |
| Look up an opcode | `get_opcode_info` |
| TDD for a subroutine | `load_program` → `validate_routine` |
| Track memory writes | `snapshot` → `run_program` → `diff_snapshot` |
| Get a code snippet | `list_patterns` → `get_pattern` |
| VIC-II output | `vic2_info` → `vic2_savescreen` or `vic2_savebitmap` |

### Example prompts

**Basic execution**
> "Load this 6502 program and tell me the value of A after it runs:"
> ```asm
> LDA #$42
> CLC
> ADC #$01
> BRK
> ```

**Step-through debugging**
> "Step through this routine one instruction at a time and show me the registers after each step."

**Memory inspection**
> "What's at memory address $0300 after the program loads?"

**Breakpoint debugging**
> "Set a breakpoint at $020A, run the program, and show me the register state when it hits."

**Processor variants**
> "Switch to the 45gs02 processor and run this quad-load example."

**Opcode reference**
> "What addressing modes does ADC support on the 65c02?"

**Trace execution**
> "Load this routine and show me every instruction it executes with register state at each step."

**TDD / validate a routine**
> "Run these three test cases against the multiply routine at $0300 and tell me which ones pass."

**Memory diff**
> "Take a snapshot, run the program, then show me every byte that changed."

**Code snippets**
> "Show me the built-in 16-bit addition snippet and adapt it to use zero-page addresses $20 and $22."

**VIC-II / graphics**
> "Run the VIC screen demo and save a screenshot of what it renders."

**Iterative development**
> "This loop should sum the bytes at $0300–$030F into A. Run it, check the result, and fix it if it's wrong."

## Limitations

- The server cannot edit `.asm` source files on disk — code is loaded as a string via `load_program`.
- Only one simulator instance runs per session. Multiple concurrent sessions require separate server processes.
- Filesystem access is limited to a temp file (`/tmp/6502_mcp_prog.asm`) used internally.
