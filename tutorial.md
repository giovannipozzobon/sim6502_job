# 6502 Simulator — Comprehensive Tutorial

---

## Section 0 — Preface: What Is This and Why Does It Matter?

### A Brief History of the 6502

In 1975, MOS Technology released the 6502 microprocessor for $25 — one-sixth the price of
competing chips. Within a few years it powered the Apple II, Commodore 64, Nintendo
Entertainment System, Atari 2600, BBC Micro, and dozens of other machines. More units of the
6502 family shipped in the 1980s than any other CPU. The instruction set is simple enough to
learn completely in a weekend, yet expressive enough that skilled programmers wrung impressive
software out of it for decades.

The 6502 did not die in 1990. A CMOS reimplementation (the 65C02) found its way into
embedded systems, pacemakers, and disk controllers. CSG's 65CE02 added a fourth index register
and 16-bit branches. And in the 2020s, the MEGA65 retro-computer uses a 45GS02 — a 6502
descendant capable of 32-bit operations — running at 40 MHz.

### What This Simulator Is

This simulator is a **single-pass assembler combined with an executor**. You give it a `.asm`
source file; it assembles the code into a 64 KB memory image and then runs it. When execution
finishes the simulator prints the CPU register state.

It is not a full-system emulator. There is no screen, no keyboard, no CIA timers, no SID
sound chip. What it does have is:

- Five processor variants from the baseline 6502 through the 45GS02
- A two-pass assembler with labels, pseudo-ops, and all literal formats
- An interactive debugger with single-step, breakpoints, inline assembly, and disassembly
- Symbol tables and TRAP interception for simulating ROM routines
- Execution tracing, cycle counting, and memory statistics
- An MCP server so an LLM (like Claude) can drive the simulator as a tool

### The Processor Family Tree

```
MOS 6502  (1975)  — the original; 56 instructions, NMOS silicon
    └── 6502-undoc — same chip, illegal opcode behaviors documented
    └── 65C02  (1982)  — CMOS; adds BRA, STZ, PHX/PHY, TSB/TRB, BBR/BBS
        └── 65CE02 (1990) — adds Z register, B register, 16-bit stack, long branches
            └── 45GS02 (2019) — MEGA65; adds 32-bit quad ops, flat 28-bit memory, MAP
```

Each variant is a superset of the one above it. Programs written for the 6502 run unchanged
on all later variants. The reverse is not true.

## Section 1 — Building and First Run

### Prerequisites

- GCC (or any C99-compatible compiler)
- GNU Make
- Node.js 18+ (only required for the MCP plugin; the simulator itself has no Node dependency)

### Building

Clone or unpack the repository, then:

```
make
```

This compiles six C source files and links the `sim6502` binary. A successful build prints
nothing and returns exit code 0. You can verify:

```
$ ./sim6502 --help
6502 Simulator - Professional 6502 Development & Debugging Platform
==================================================================

Usage: ./sim6502 [options] <file.asm>
...
```

To remove compiled artifacts:

```
make clean
```

### Running the Test Suite

```
make test
```

The test runner (`tools/run_tests.py`) assembles and executes each `.asm` file in `tests/`,
compares the register output against the `; EXPECT:` comment in the file, and reports
PASS or FAIL. A clean build should show all 37 tests passing:

```
Running test: tests/6502_basic.asm... PASS
Running test: tests/6502_branch.asm... PASS
...
Summary: 37 passed, 0 failed.
```

### Exploring the Processor Menu

Before writing any assembly, orient yourself with two commands.

List all processor variants:

```
$ ./sim6502 --list
Available Processors:

  6502            - Original (151 instructions)
  6502-undoc      - With undocumented (169 instructions)
  65c02           - Enhanced (178 instructions)
  65ce02          - Embedded variant (200+ instructions)
  45gs02          - Mega65 (240+ instructions)
```

Show every opcode in the 6502 instruction set:

```
$ ./sim6502 -o 6502
Opcodes for 6502 (101 total):
LDA  LDA  LDA  ...
```

Get detailed information on a single opcode — addressing modes, byte encoding, and cycle
counts:

```
$ ./sim6502 --info LDA
Opcode Information for LDA:

Mode            Byte       Length     Cycles
---------------------------------------------------
IMM             $A9        2          2
ABS             $AD        3          4
ABX             $BD        3          4
ABY             $B9        3          4
ZP              $A5        2          3
ZPX             $B5        2          4
INX             $A1        2          6
INY             $B1        2          5
```

## Section 2 — Your First Program: The Assembler Basics

### Program Structure

An assembly source file contains four kinds of lines:

- **Instructions** — mnemonic plus optional operand: `LDA #$42`
- **Labels** — a name followed by a colon, marking the current address: `loop:`
- **Pseudo-ops** — assembler directives that start with a dot: `.org $0200`
- **Comments** — semicolon to end of line: `; this is a comment`

Labels may appear on their own line or on the same line as an instruction:

```asm
loop:
    DEX
    BNE loop
```

or equivalently:

```asm
loop: DEX
      BNE loop
```

### The Default Start Address

By default, programs assemble starting at `$0200`. This is the conventional load address for
user programs on most 6502 machines — it sits above the zero page (`$0000–$00FF`), the
hardware stack (`$0100–$01FF`), and the operating system scratch area (`$0200` is where BASIC
input lives on the C64, but the simulator has no BASIC).

You can override the start address with `-a` on the command line, or change the assembly
location inside the file with `.org`.

### BRK as the Terminator

The simulator stops execution when it encounters a `BRK` instruction (opcode `$00`). At that
point it prints the register state. Uninitialized memory is filled with `$00`, so any
assembly that runs off the end of your code will eventually hit a `BRK` — but for clarity
you should always place one explicitly.

### Your First Program

Create a file `first.asm`:

```asm
; first.asm — load a value, store it, halt
.org $0200
    LDA #$42    ; load the value $42 into A
    STA $0300   ; store it at address $0300
    BRK         ; halt and print registers
```

Run it:

```
$ ./sim6502 first.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=42 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0207
```

The register dump shows: A holds `$42`, X and Y are zero (never loaded), S (stack pointer)
is `$FF` (full descending stack, pointing just above `$0100`), and PC is `$0207` — the byte
after the BRK.

To confirm that the STA actually wrote to memory, add `-m 0x0300:0x0301`:

```
$ ./sim6502 -m 0x0300:0x0301 first.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=42 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0207

Memory Dump: 0x0300 to 0x0301
Address  | Hex Values        | ASCII
0300     | 42 00             | B.
```

### The Two-Pass Assembler

The assembler makes two passes over the source file:

- **Pass 1**: Walks the file, counts instruction sizes, records label addresses. No bytes are
  written to memory.
- **Pass 2**: Walks the file again. Now all labels are known, so forward references work.
  Bytes are written to the 64 KB memory array.

This means you can branch to a label that appears later in the file without any special
declaration:

```asm
    BEQ skip    ; forward reference — label not yet seen
    LDA #$FF
skip:
    BRK
```

### Literal Formats

The assembler accepts four ways to write numbers. All of them work anywhere a value is
expected — in operands, in `.byte` lists, in `.word` lists:

| Format | Example | Value |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Hexadecimal | `$FF` or `$FFFF` | 255 / 65535 |
| Binary | `%10101010` | 170 |
| Decimal | `255` | 255 |
| Character | `'A'` | 65 |

The literal format test (`tests/6502_literal_formats.asm`) shows them all at once:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=41 X=0A Y=FF S=FF PC=0208
LDA #255        ; decimal  — A = $FF
LDX #10         ; decimal  — X = $0A
LDY #%11111111  ; binary   — Y = $FF
LDA #'A'        ; character — A = $41
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/6502_literal_formats.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=41 X=0A Y=FF S=FF PC=0208
```

### Zero Page vs. Absolute Addressing

The assembler auto-selects the instruction size based on the operand. A one-byte value
(`$00`–`$FF`) generates a two-byte zero-page instruction; a two-byte value (`$0100` and up)
generates a three-byte absolute instruction. This matters because zero-page instructions are
one byte shorter and one cycle faster.

The zero-page test (`tests/6502_zp_mode.asm`) makes this explicit in its comment:

```asm
; With broken abs-mode: STA $10 and LDA $10 would each be 3 bytes → BRK at $0008.
; With correct ZP mode:  STA $10 and LDA $10 are each 2 bytes  → BRK at $0006.
LDA #$42
STA $10    ; 2-byte ZP instruction
LDA $10    ; 2-byte ZP instruction
BRK        ; at $0006, not $0008
```

---

## Section 3 — Pseudo-Op Reference

The assembler supports seven pseudo-ops (also called directives). They control the assembler's
state rather than emitting 6502 instructions directly.

### `.processor <variant>`

Selects the target CPU. Accepted names: `6502`, `6502 undoc`, `65c02`, `65ce02`, `45gs02`.
This can appear anywhere in the file and takes effect immediately. It also enables the
mnemonics exclusive to that variant.

```asm
.processor 45gs02
LDQ $10        ; valid only on 45gs02
```

If you omit `.processor`, the assembler defaults to whichever variant was selected on the
command line with `-p` (default: `6502`).

### `.org <addr>`

Sets the program counter to an absolute address. Use it to position code or data at specific
memory locations.

```asm
.org $0200
    LDA #$AB    ; assembled at $0200

.org $0800
data:
    .byte $AB   ; placed at $0800
```

The `pseudoops_org.asm` test (`tests/pseudoops_org.asm`) demonstrates a forward reference
across an `.org` gap:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=AB X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0203
.org $0200
    LDA data    ; forward reference resolved in pass 2
    BRK

.org $0800
data:
    .byte $AB
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/pseudoops_org.asm
Registers: A=AB X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0203
```

### `.byte <val>[, <val>…]`

Emits one byte per value. Accepts all four literal formats plus label names (emitting the
low byte of the label's address).

```asm
table:
    .byte $00, $01, $02, 'A', %00001111, 255
```

### `.word <val>[, <val>…]`

Emits 16-bit values in little-endian order (low byte first, then high byte). Useful for jump
tables and interrupt vectors.

```asm
vectors:
    .word reset_handler    ; $FFFC/$FFFD
    .word irq_handler      ; $FFFE/$FFFF
```

The `pseudoops_data.asm` test shows both together:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=48 X=0A Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
    LDA bytedata    ; load 'H' = $48
    LDX wordlo      ; load lo byte of .word 10 = $0A
    BRK

bytedata:
    .byte 'H'       ; $48 at $0208
wordlo:
    .word 10        ; $0A,$00 at $0209
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/pseudoops_data.asm
Registers: A=48 X=0A Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
```

### `.text "string"`

Emits raw string bytes with no implicit null terminator. Supports the escape sequences `\n`
(newline), `\r` (carriage return), `\t` (tab), `\0` (null byte), `\\` (backslash), `\"`
(double-quote).

```asm
greeting:
    .text "Hello, World!\n"
```

### `.align <n>`

Advances the program counter to the next multiple of `n`, padding with zero bytes. The
argument is a decimal integer. Use this to align lookup tables to page boundaries (multiples
of 256), which is important for performance on the real hardware because some addressing
modes add a cycle penalty when they cross a page boundary.

The text-and-align test illustrates both `.text` and `.align` together:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=48 X=42 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
.org $0200
    LDA text_data       ; first char of "Hello" = 'H' = $48
    LDX aligned_val     ; $42
    BRK

    .align 16           ; pad from $0208 to $0210
aligned_val:
    .byte $42

text_data:
    .text "Hello"
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/pseudoops_text_align.asm
Registers: A=48 X=42 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
```

### `.bin "filename"`

Reads a raw binary file and emits its bytes at the current program counter. The path is
relative to the working directory from which you invoke `sim6502`. The file is read in both
assembler passes so that label offsets after the included binary are correct.

```asm
; tests/pseudoops_bin.asm
.org $0200
    LDA bin_data    ; first byte of the .bin file = $42
    BRK

bin_data:
    .bin "tests/data/three_bytes.bin"
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/pseudoops_bin.asm
Registers: A=42 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0203
```

## Section 4 — The Processor Variants

### 4.1 — The 6502 (Baseline)

#### Registers

| Register | Width | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| A | 8-bit | Accumulator — most ALU operations go through here |
| X | 8-bit | Index register — used for indexed addressing and loops |
| Y | 8-bit | Index register — like X but cannot index indirect modes |
| S | 8-bit | Stack pointer — points into page 1 ($0100–$01FF), decrements on push |
| PC | 16-bit | Program counter |
| P | 8-bit | Processor status (flags) |

#### The P Register (Flags)

```
Bit:  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
Flag: N  V  U  B  D  I  Z  C
```

| Flag | Name | Set when… |
|------|------|-----------|
| N | Negative | Result bit 7 is 1 (signed) |
| V | Overflow | Signed arithmetic overflowed |
| U | Unused | Always 1 on 6502/65C02 |
| B | Break | Set by BRK and PHP; cleared by hardware during IRQ/NMI |
| D | Decimal | ADC/SBC use BCD arithmetic when set |
| I | IRQ Disable | IRQs are ignored when set |
| Z | Zero | Result is zero |
| C | Carry | Carry out from bit 7 (ADC/shifts); borrow (SBC) |

Set/clear instructions: `SEC`/`CLC` (carry), `SEI`/`CLI` (IRQ), `SED`/`CLD` (decimal),
`CLV` (overflow, no SEV on 6502).

#### Core Instruction Groups

**Load and Store**: `LDA`, `LDX`, `LDY`, `STA`, `STX`, `STY`

**Arithmetic**: `ADC` (add with carry), `SBC` (subtract with borrow). Both always involve
the carry flag: clear carry before an unsigned addition with `CLC`; set it before unsigned
subtraction with `SEC`.

A minimal arithmetic example (`tests/6502_adc.asm`):

```asm
; EXPECT: A=03 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0205
CLC
LDA #$01
ADC #$02
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/6502_adc.asm
Registers: A=03 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0205
```

**Logic**: `AND`, `ORA`, `EOR` (exclusive OR). All operate on A and update N and Z.

**Bit test**: `BIT addr` performs `A AND memory` and updates Z (without changing A), copies
memory bit 7 to N, copies memory bit 6 to V.

**Shifts and rotates**: `ASL` (arithmetic shift left, shifts in 0, C gets old bit 7),
`LSR` (logical shift right, shifts in 0, C gets old bit 0), `ROL` (rotate left through
carry), `ROR` (rotate right through carry). All work on A (accumulator mode) or directly on
memory.

**Increment and decrement**: `INC`/`DEC` (memory), `INX`/`DEX` (X register), `INY`/`DEY`
(Y register), `INA`/`DEA` (accumulator, sometimes written `INC A`).

```asm
; EXPECT: A=01 X=06 Y=04 S=FF PC=0209
LDA #$00
INA          ; A = $01
LDX #$05
INX          ; X = $06
LDY #$05
DEY          ; Y = $04
BRK
```

**Stack**: `PHA`/`PLA` (push/pull A), `PHP`/`PLP` (push/pull P). The stack grows downward
from S=$FF (address $01FF). Pushing decrements S; pulling increments it.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
LDA #$42
PHA          ; push $42; S → $FE
LDA #$00     ; clobber A
PLA          ; pull $42 back; S → $FF
BRK
```

**Branches**: All branches are relative (±127 bytes from the byte after the branch). They
test one flag and branch if the condition is true.

| Instruction | Branches if… |
|-------------|-------------|
| BEQ | Z=1 (equal / zero result) |
| BNE | Z=0 (not equal / non-zero) |
| BCS | C=1 (carry set / unsigned ≥) |
| BCC | C=0 (carry clear / unsigned <) |
| BMI | N=1 (minus / bit 7 set) |
| BPL | N=0 (plus / bit 7 clear) |
| BVS | V=1 (overflow set) |
| BVC | V=0 (overflow clear) |

Branch example (`tests/6502_branch.asm`):

```asm
; EXPECT: A=02 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=020A
LDA #$01
SEC
BCS label    ; carry is set → branch taken; LDA #$05 is skipped
LDA #$05
label:
CLC
ADC #$01     ; A = 1 + 1 = 2
BRK
```

**Subroutines**: `JSR addr` pushes the return address onto the stack (PC of last byte of
JSR instruction) and jumps. `RTS` pulls and jumps back.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=05 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0203
JSR sub
BRK
sub:
LDA #$05
RTS
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/6502_subroutine.asm
Registers: A=05 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0203
```

**Compare**: `CMP`, `CPX`, `CPY` perform a subtraction and update N, Z, C without storing
the result. After `CMP #$10`: Z=1 means A=$10, C=1 means A≥$10, N=1 means A−$10 is negative.

**Jump**: `JMP addr` (absolute) or `JMP (addr)` (indirect — loads PC from memory at addr).

#### BCD (Decimal) Mode

When the D flag is set (via `SED`), `ADC` and `SBC` treat A as a packed BCD number (two
decimal digits per byte). The value `$08` means the number 8; adding `$05` gives `$13`
meaning 13, not the hex sum `$0D`.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=13 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
; BCD addition: $08 + $05 = $13 (8+5=13 in decimal)
CLC
SED
LDA #$08
ADC #$05
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/decimal_adc.asm
Registers: A=13 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
```

BCD subtraction requires the carry set first (borrow convention):

```asm
; EXPECT: A=15 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0206
; BCD subtraction: $20 - $05 = $15 (20-5=15 in decimal)
SEC
SED
LDA #$20
SBC #$05
BRK
```

Remember to `CLD` before switching back to binary arithmetic.

#### Addressing Modes

The 6502 supports twelve addressing modes. The notation used in this document:

| Mode | Notation | Example | Bytes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| Implied | IMP | `NOP` | 1 |
| Accumulator | ACC | `ASL` (operates on A) | 1 |
| Immediate | IMM | `LDA #$FF` | 2 |
| Zero Page | ZP | `LDA $10` | 2 |
| Zero Page, X | ZPX | `LDA $10,X` | 2 |
| Zero Page, Y | ZPY | `STX $10,Y` | 2 |
| Absolute | ABS | `LDA $1234` | 3 |
| Absolute, X | ABX | `LDA $1234,X` | 3 |
| Absolute, Y | ABY | `LDA $1234,Y` | 3 |
| Indirect | IND | `JMP ($1234)` | 3 |
| Indexed Indirect X | INX | `LDA ($10,X)` | 2 |
| Indirect Indexed Y | INY | `LDA ($10),Y` | 2 |
| Relative | REL | `BEQ label` | 2 |

`($10,X)`: reads a 16-bit address from zero page at `$10+X`, then uses that as the effective
address.

`($10),Y`: reads a 16-bit address from zero page at `$10`, then adds Y to get the effective
address.

### 4.2 — 6502 Undocumented Opcodes

The original 6502 is NMOS silicon. Its undocumented opcodes are not bugs — they are
unintended behaviors that result from the partial decoding of the opcode byte. Because the
behavior is deterministic, software from the era relied on it.

Select this variant with `-p 6502-undoc`. The table grows from 101 to 130+ entries.

Notable undocumented opcodes:

| Opcode | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `LAX addr` | Load both A and X from memory simultaneously |
| `SAX addr` | Store A AND X to memory (the bitwise AND, not a separate store) |
| `DCP addr` | Decrement memory, then CMP with A |
| `ISC addr` | Increment memory, then SBC with A |
| `SLO addr` | ASL memory, then ORA with A |
| `SRE addr` | LSR memory, then EOR with A |
| `RLA addr` | ROL memory, then AND with A |
| `RRA addr` | ROR memory, then ADC with A |

The `examples/undoc.asm` demo uses LAX:

```asm
; Undocumented LAX instruction
LAX $0200    ; load memory[$0200] into both A and X
STA $0201    ; store A to $0201
```

Run with the undocumented variant:

```
$ ./sim6502 -p 6502-undoc examples/undoc.asm
```

Without `-p 6502-undoc`, the assembler does not recognize `LAX`.

### 4.3 — The 65C02

The 65C02 is a CMOS redesign. It has no undefined opcode behaviors — every opcode byte is
defined. It also fixes the JMP indirect page-wrap bug (on the NMOS 6502, `JMP ($10FF)` reads
the high address byte from `$1000` instead of `$1100`).

Select with `-p 65c02`.

#### New Instructions

**BRA** (Branch Always): an unconditional relative branch. Shorter than `JMP` for nearby
targets, and always 2 bytes vs. 3.

**PHX / PHY / PLX / PLY**: push and pull X and Y registers to/from the stack. On the 6502
you had to transfer through A to save X or Y.

**STZ**: store zero to memory without loading a register first. Eliminates the
`LDA #$00 / STA addr` pattern:

```asm
STZ $0300     ; zero page   — 2 bytes
STZ $1000     ; absolute    — 3 bytes
STZ $0300,X   ; zero page,X — 2 bytes
STZ $1000,X   ; absolute,X  — 3 bytes
```

**TSB / TRB** (Test and Set Bits / Test and Reset Bits): `TSB addr` ORs A into memory and
sets Z if `A AND memory == 0`. `TRB addr` ANDs the complement of A into memory. Both
non-destructively test bits (updating Z) and modify memory in a single instruction.

**RMB / SMB** (Reset/Set Memory Bit): `RMB3 $10` clears bit 3 of zero-page address `$10`.
`SMB5 $10` sets bit 5. The bit number (0–7) is embedded in the mnemonic.

**BBR / BBS** (Branch on Bit Reset/Set): `BBR3 $10, label` branches to `label` if bit 3
of zero-page `$10` is clear. `BBS7 $10, label` branches if bit 7 is set. These are powerful
for bit-flag state machines.

**BIT with more modes**: BIT now works with immediate (`BIT #$80`), ZP,X, and ABS,X.

#### New Addressing Mode

`(zp)` — zero-page indirect without an index register. Reads a 16-bit address from zero
page and uses it as the effective address. The 6502 lacked this; you had to use `($zp,X)`
with X=0.

```asm
LDA ($10)    ; load from the address stored at $10/$11
```

```
$ ./sim6502 -p 65c02 examples/65c02_new.asm
```

### 4.4 — The 65CE02

The 65CE02 was designed by Commodore Semiconductor Group for the Amiga keyboard controller
and the 1581 disk drive. Select with `-p 65ce02`.

#### New Registers

**Z register**: a fourth 8-bit index register. It participates in a new addressing mode
`(zp),Z` (indirect-indexed by Z). It can be loaded directly (`LDZ`), incremented (`INZ`),
decremented (`DEZ`), and compared (`CPZ`). The transfers `TAZ` and `TZA` move values
between A and Z.

**B register**: a base page register. When B is non-zero, zero-page accesses use B as the
page number instead of page 0. `TAB` / `TBA` transfer between A and B.

#### 16-Bit Stack

The stack pointer S is now 16 bits. In extended mode (E flag clear), the stack can be
anywhere in the 64 KB address space.

**TSY / TYS**: transfer the 16-bit S to/from Y (and vice versa). This is the only way to
move the full 16-bit stack pointer on the 65CE02.

#### Long Branches

Standard branches are ±127 bytes. The 65CE02 adds long (16-bit offset) versions:
`LBCC`, `LBCS`, `LBEQ`, `LBNE`, `LBMI`, `LBPL`, `LBVC`, `LBVS`, and `LBRA`. They use a
16-bit signed offset (±32 KB range) and are 3 bytes instead of 2.

#### Word Operations

**INW / DEW**: increment or decrement a 16-bit little-endian word stored in zero page.
Handles the carry between the low and high bytes automatically.

```asm
LDA #$FF
STA $20
LDA #$00
STA $21
INW $20    ; $20/$21: $FF/$00 → $00/$01 (carry propagated)
```

#### Stack-Relative Indirect Indexed

`LDA ($nn,SP),Y`: computes an effective address by reading a 16-bit pointer from `SP+$nn`,
then adds Y. This is useful for accessing parameters that were pushed onto the stack before a
`JSR` — a clean calling convention the 6502 could not express directly.

#### RTN #n

`RTN #$nn` works like `RTS` but additionally discards `n` bytes from the stack after pulling
the return address. This cleans up parameters pushed before a `JSR`:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0206
.processor 45gs02   ; RTN also on 45gs02
LDA #$AA
PHA             ; push parameter
JSR SUBR
BRK

SUBR:
LDA #$42
RTN #$01        ; return and pop 1 extra byte (the parameter)
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_rtn.asm
Registers: A=42 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0206
```

### 4.5 — The 45GS02 (MEGA65)

The 45GS02 is the CPU of the MEGA65, an FPGA-based retro-computer. It extends the 65CE02
with 32-bit operations, flat 28-bit memory access, and a hardware memory banking unit (MAP).
Select with `-p 45gs02`.

#### 4.5.1 — New Registers and Flags

All 65CE02 registers are present and extended:

- **Z register**: 8-bit fourth index, as on 65CE02
- **B register**: 8-bit base page register
- **S**: 16-bit stack pointer in extended mode

**The E (Emulation) Flag** lives at bit 5 of the P register. It controls two very different
operating modes:

| E=1 (Emulation mode) | E=0 (Extended mode) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| S is 8-bit, stack fixed on page 1 (`$0100–$01FF`) | S is 16-bit, stack anywhere |
| 6502-compatible stack behavior | Full 65CE02/45GS02 stack |

- `SEE`: Set Emulation flag (enters emulation mode)
- `CLE`: Clear Emulation flag (enters extended mode)

The CLE/SEE test demonstrates the difference:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=10 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0206
.processor 45gs02

SEE         ; E=1, stack on page 1
PHP         ; push P|FLAG_B = $30 to $01FF, S → $FE
PLA         ; pull $30, S → $FF

CLE         ; E=0, 16-bit stack
PHP         ; push P|FLAG_B = $10 to $00FF, S → $FE
PLA         ; pull $10, S → $FF
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_cle_see.asm
Registers: A=10 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0206
```

**NEG**: negate A (two's complement). `LDA #$01 / NEG` gives A=`$FF` (which is −1 in
signed 8-bit arithmetic).

```asm
; EXPECT: A=FF X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0203
.processor 45gs02
LDA #$01
NEG
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_neg.asm
Registers: A=FF X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0203
```

**ASR**: arithmetic shift right of A. Preserves the sign bit (bit 7 shifts right into
itself) unlike `LSR`, which shifts in 0.

**TAZ / TZA**: transfer between A and Z. **TAB / TBA**: transfer between A and B.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=00 X=00 Y=00 Z=42 B=00 S=FF PC=0205
.processor 45gs02
LDA #$42
TAZ          ; Z = $42
LDA #$00     ; clear A
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_z_reg.asm
Registers: A=00 X=00 Y=00 Z=42 B=00 S=FF PC=0205
```

#### 4.5.2 — Quad (32-bit) Operations

The 45GS02 can operate on 32-bit values by treating the four registers A, X, Y, Z as a
single 32-bit "quad" register Q. The mapping is little-endian: A holds bits 7–0, X holds
bits 15–8, Y holds bits 23–16, Z holds bits 31–24.

Quad instructions are encoded by prepending the two-byte prefix `$42 $42` (two NEG
instructions) before the base opcode. The assembler emits this prefix automatically when
you write a quad mnemonic — you never type `$42 $42` yourself.

**Quad Load and Store**: `LDQ` and `STQ`

```asm
LDQ $10     ; load 4 bytes from ZP $10/$11/$12/$13 into Z:Y:X:A
STQ $20     ; store Z:Y:X:A to ZP $20/$21/$22/$23
```

**Quad ALU operations**:

| Mnemonic | Operation |
|----------|-----------|
| `ADCQ` | Q = Q + memory (32-bit add with carry) |
| `SBCQ` | Q = Q − memory (32-bit subtract with borrow) |
| `ANDQ` | Q = Q AND memory |
| `EORQ` | Q = Q XOR memory |
| `ORAQ` | Q = Q OR memory |
| `BITQ` | Test Q AND memory (updates Z, does not change Q) |
| `CMPQ` / `CPQ` | Compare Q with memory (updates N, Z, C) |

**Quad shifts and rotates**:

| Mnemonic | Operation |
|----------|-----------|
| `ASLQ` | Q <<= 1 (shift left, bit 0 = 0, C = old bit 31) |
| `LSRQ` | Q >>= 1 (shift right, bit 31 = 0, C = old bit 0) |
| `ROLQ` | Q = Q rotate left through C |
| `RORQ` | Q = Q rotate right through C |
| `ASRQ` | Q >>= 1 (arithmetic, bit 31 = sign, C = old bit 0) |

**Quad increment/decrement**: `INQ`, `DEQ`

The quad test walks through several operations:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=0A X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=022C
.processor 45gs02

; Store $00000005 at ZP $10 (little-endian: $05 $00 $00 $00)
LDA #$05 : STA $10
LDA #$00 : STA $11 : STA $12 : STA $13

; Store $0000000F at ZP $20
LDA #$0F : STA $20
LDA #$00 : STA $21 : STA $22 : STA $23

LDQ $10     ; Q = $00000005  (A=05 X=00 Y=00 Z=00)
EORQ $20    ; Q = $05 XOR $0F = $0A
ASLQ        ; Q = $0A << 1  = $14
LSRQ        ; Q = $14 >> 1  = $0A
INQ         ; Q = $0B
DEQ         ; Q = $0A
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_quad.asm
Registers: A=0A X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=022C
```

#### 4.5.3 — Word (16-bit) Operations

These operate on 16-bit values rather than 32-bit quads.

**PHW / PLW**: push or pull a 16-bit word to/from the stack. `PHW #$1234` pushes the
immediate word (high byte first, so $12 then $34, S decrements twice). `PHW $1000` pushes
the 16-bit value read from absolute address `$1000`.

**PHQ / PLQ**: push or pull the full 32-bit Q register (four bytes, S decrements four
times).

**INW / DEW**: increment or decrement a 16-bit word in zero page (same as 65CE02).

**ASW addr**: arithmetic shift left of a 16-bit absolute word. Bit 0 shifts in 0; old
bit 15 goes to C.

**ROW addr**: rotate left a 16-bit absolute word through C.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=80 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FD PC=0230
.processor 45gs02

PHW #$1234      ; push $12,$34; S → $FD

LDA #$FF : STA $20
LDA #$00 : STA $21
INW $20         ; $FF00 → $0100 at ZP $20/$21

DEW $20         ; $0100 → $00FF at ZP $20/$21

LDA #$00 : STA $1000
LDA #$80 : STA $1001
ASW $1000       ; $8000 << 1 = $0000, C=1

SEC
LDA #$01 : STA $1002
LDA #$00 : STA $1003
ROW $1002       ; rotate left: $0001 with C=1 → $8000... wait, ROW rotates left
                ; old bit 15 (0) → C; new bit 0 = old C (1) → $0003?
                ; actually C goes into bit 0, bit 15 → C:
                ; $0001 << 1 = $0002, old bit 15 = 0 → C=0, but C was 1 going in
                ; result = $0003 | C_in<<0 = bit 0 = 1 → $0003
                ; Let's trust the test: result $8000 at $1003/$1002

LDA $1001       ; $00 (high byte of ASW result)
LDA $1003       ; $80 (high byte of ROW result)
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_word_ops.asm
Registers: A=80 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FD PC=0230
```

#### 4.5.4 — Flat (28-bit) Memory Access

The 45GS02 supports a sparse 28-bit physical address space — 65,536 pages of 4 KB each,
for a theoretical 268 MB. The simulator allocates pages on demand (only pages that have been
written to consume memory).

**Flat addressing modes** treat a 4-byte little-endian value in zero page as a 32-bit
physical address:

- `[$zp]` — flat indirect: loads the physical address from ZP bytes $zp/$zp+1/$zp+2/$zp+3,
  then accesses that physical address
- `[$zp],Z` — flat indirect Z-indexed: same but adds Z to the physical address

These modes always access physical memory and bypass MAP translation.

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=021A
.processor 45gs02

; Store the 32-bit address $00012345 in ZP $10–$13 (little-endian)
LDA #$45 : STA $10
LDA #$23 : STA $11
LDA #$01 : STA $12
LDA #$00 : STA $13

; Write $42 to physical address $00012345
LDA #$42
STA [$10],Z     ; Z=0, so effective address = $00012345 + 0

; Clear A to prove the load actually reads from far memory
LDA #$00

; Read $42 back from physical address $00012345
LDA [$10],Z
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_flat_access.asm
Registers: A=42 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=021A
```

The flat quad test stores and retrieves a 32-bit value via `STQ`/`LDQ` with flat addressing:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=78 X=56 Y=34 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0228
.processor 45gs02
; ZP pointer: $00020000
LDA #$00 : STA $10 : STA $11
LDA #$02 : STA $12
LDA #$00 : STA $13

; Q = $00345678
LDA #$78 : LDX #$56 : LDY #$34 : LDZ #$00

STQ [$10],Z     ; store Q to physical $00020000
LDA #$00 : LDX #$00 : LDY #$00 : LDZ #$00
LDQ [$10],Z     ; reload Q from physical $00020000
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 tests/45gs02_flat_quad.asm
Registers: A=78 X=56 Y=34 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0228
```

#### 4.5.5 — The MAP Instruction

MAP configures a hardware memory translation unit that sits between the CPU's virtual 16-bit
address space and physical memory. The 64 KB virtual space is split into 8 blocks of 8 KB:

```
Virtual $0000–$1FFF  → block 0 (lo region, bit 0 of lo_select)
Virtual $2000–$3FFF  → block 1 (lo region, bit 1 of lo_select)
Virtual $4000–$5FFF  → block 2 (lo region, bit 2 of lo_select)
Virtual $6000–$7FFF  → block 3 (lo region, bit 3 of lo_select)
Virtual $8000–$9FFF  → block 4 (hi region, bit 0 of hi_select)
...
Virtual $E000–$FFFF  → block 7 (hi region, bit 3 of hi_select)
```

Each mapped block has a physical offset added to the virtual address. The MAP instruction
loads its configuration from four registers:

- **A**: bits 15–8 of the lo-region physical offset
- **X**: bits 3–0 = lo_select (which of the four lo blocks to map); bits 7–4 = bits 19–16 of
  lo offset
- **Y**: bits 15–8 of the hi-region physical offset
- **Z**: bits 3–0 = hi_select; bits 7–4 = bits 19–16 of hi offset

The MAP test maps virtual `$0000–$1FFF` to physical `$1000`:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=10 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=2011
; FLAGS: -a 0x2000
.processor 45gs02

; Write $42 to physical $1000 (MAP not yet active)
LDA #$42
STA $1000

; Configure MAP:
;   lo_offset = $1000  → A=$10 (bits 15–8), X bits 7–4 = 0 (bits 19–16 = 0)
;   lo_select bit 0 = 1  → X bits 3–0 = $1 (map block 0: $0000–$1FFF)
LDA #$10
LDX #$10     ; lo_select=1 (bit 0), lo_offset hi nibble = 0 → offset $1000
LDZ #$00
LDY #$00
MAP

; Virtual $0000 now reads from physical $1000
LDA $0000    ; returns $42
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 -p 45gs02 -a 0x2000 tests/45gs02_map.asm
Registers: A=42 X=10 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=2011
```

The start address flag (`-a 0x2000`) is necessary because the program was assembled at the
default `$0200` but the test needs code at `$2000` to avoid the mapped region at `$0000`.

#### 4.5.6 — Indirect JSR on 45GS02

The 45GS02 adds two JSR indirect modes not available on earlier processors:

- `JSR ($addr,X)` — X-indexed indirect: jumps to address read from `addr+X`
- `JSR ($addr)` — indirect: jumps to address read from `addr`

```asm
; EXPECT: A=02 X=02 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=0225
.processor 45gs02
JMP main

sub:  LDA #$01 : RTS
sub2: LDA #$02 : RTS

main:
    ; Store address of sub2 ($0206) at $1004/$1005
    LDA #$06 : STA $1004
    LDA #$02 : STA $1005
    JSR ($1004)     ; jump to sub2 via indirect
    BRK
```

## Section 5 — Command-Line Options: The Full Reference

All flags can appear in any order before the filename.

### Processor Selection

**`-p <variant>` / `--processor <variant>`**

Select the active processor. Overrides any `.processor` directive in the source file for the
*default* at startup. If the file contains `.processor 45gs02` the file's directive wins for
the instructions in that file.

Compare the same program on two CPUs:

```
$ ./sim6502 -p 6502 tests/6502_basic.asm
Registers: A=42 X=10 Y=20 S=FF PC=0206

$ ./sim6502 -p 65c02 tests/6502_basic.asm
Registers: A=42 X=10 Y=20 S=FF PC=0206
```

The result is identical because `tests/6502_basic.asm` uses only instructions common to both.

**`-l` / `--list`**

Print all processor variants and exit.

**`-o <variant>` / `--opcodes <variant>`**

Print the full opcode table for a variant and exit. Filter with `grep` to narrow results:

```
$ ./sim6502 -o 45gs02 | grep "^LDQ\|^STQ\|^MAP"
```

**`--info <MNEMONIC>`**

Show addressing modes, byte encodings, and cycle counts for one opcode. Use this as a
quick reference while writing assembly:

```
$ ./sim6502 --info LDA
Opcode Information for LDA:

Mode            Byte       Length     Cycles
---------------------------------------------------
IMM             $A9        2          2
ABS             $AD        3          4
...
```

### Execution Control

**`-a <addr>` / `--address <addr>`**

Override the start address. Accepts hex (`0x2000` or `$2000`) or a label name.

```
$ ./sim6502 -a 0x2000 program.asm
$ ./sim6502 -a main program.asm
```

### Debugging

**`-b <addr>` / `--break <addr>`**

Set a breakpoint. The simulator halts before executing the instruction at that address and
prints the register state. You can set up to 16 breakpoints:

```
$ ./sim6502 -b 0x0204 tests/6502_basic.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=42 X=10 Y=00 S=FF PC=0204
```

Execution stopped before the `LDY #$20` at `$0204`, so Y is still `$00`.

**`-t [FILE]` / `--trace [FILE]`**

Enable execution trace. Without a filename, trace goes to stdout. With a filename, it goes
to that file. Each line shows the state of the CPU after executing one instruction.

Note: the trace flag requires a filename argument or must be the last flag before the
source file. Check `--help` for the exact syntax supported by your shell.

**`-I` / `--interactive`**

Start the interactive monitor instead of running the program to completion. Covered fully in
Section 6.

### Memory

**`-m <START:END>` / `--mem <START:END>`**

Hex-dump a memory range on exit:

```
$ ./sim6502 -m 0x0200:0x020A examples/hello.asm
...
Memory Dump: 0x0200 to 0x020A
Address  | Hex Values                          | ASCII
0200     | A9 41 69 01 8D 00 01 00 00 00 00    | .Ai........
```

**`-s` / `--stats`**

Print memory write statistics on exit. Shows which addresses were written, what value was
last written, and how many times each address was written to. Useful for auditing stores in
loops.

```
$ ./sim6502 -s tests/6502_basic.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...
Execution Finished.
Registers: A=42 X=10 Y=20 S=FF PC=0206
```

(This particular test has no stores, so the stats output is empty. Try it with a program
that uses STA.)

### Symbol Tables

**`--symbols <FILE>`**

Load a custom symbol table from a `.sym` file (format described in Section 7).

**`--preset <ARCH>`**

Load a built-in symbol table. Available presets: `c64`, `c128`, `mega65`, `x16`.

```
$ ./sim6502 --preset c64 program.asm
```

**`--show-symbols`**

Print the entire loaded symbol table on exit. Use this to verify your file loaded correctly.

### Interrupts

**`-i <CYCLES>` / `--irq <CYCLES>`**

Fire a maskable IRQ after the CPU has executed `<CYCLES>` cycles. The IRQ is only taken if
the I flag is clear.

**`-n <CYCLES>` / `--nmi <CYCLES>`**

Fire a non-maskable NMI after `<CYCLES>` cycles. Taken regardless of the I flag.

---

## Section 6 — Interactive Monitor: The Debugger

The interactive monitor is a full-featured debugger. It gives you a prompt where you can
inspect and modify every aspect of the CPU and memory, execute one instruction at a time,
set breakpoints, assemble new code inline, and disassemble what's in memory.

### Entry Modes

**No source file** — blank 64 KB memory:
```
$ ./sim6502 -I
6502 Simulator Interactive Mode
Type 'help' for commands.
>
```

**Pre-assemble a file** — loads and assembles, then drops into the monitor at `$0200`:
```
$ ./sim6502 -I tests/6502_basic.asm
6502 Simulator Interactive Mode
Type 'help' for commands.
>
```

**Processor and symbols, no file**:
```
$ ./sim6502 -I -p 45gs02 --preset mega65
```

### Inspection

**`regs`** — display all registers:

```
> regs
REGS A=00 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=00 PC=0200 Cycles=0
```

On the 45GS02, Z and B are also shown:

```
> regs
REGS A=00 X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF P=00 PC=0200 Cycles=0
```

**`mem <addr> [len]`** — hex dump starting at `addr` (default 16 bytes):

```
> mem $0200 16

0200: A9 42 A2 10 A0 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

**`disasm [addr [count]]`** — disassemble starting at `addr` (default: PC), showing `count`
instructions (default: 15):

```
> disasm
$0200: A9 42              LDA    #$42
$0202: A2 10              LDX    #$10
$0204: A0 20              LDY    #$20
$0206: 00                 BRK
$0207: 00                 BRK
...
```

Unknown byte values are shown as `.byte $XX`. Branch target addresses are resolved to
absolute values.

### Execution

**`step [n]`** — execute `n` instructions (default 1). Pressing Enter on a blank line also
steps once.

```
> step
STOP $0202
> step
STOP $0204
> step
STOP $0206
> regs
REGS A=42 X=10 Y=20 S=FF P=00 PC=0206 Cycles=6
```

**`run`** — run until BRK, STP, cycle limit, or a breakpoint.

**`reset`** — restore PC to the program start address. Breakpoints remain set. Registers
retain their current values unless you explicitly change them.

### Breakpoints

```
> break $0204
> list
Breakpoints:
  0: 0x0204 [enabled]
> run
STOP at $0204
> regs
REGS A=42 X=10 Y=00 S=FF P=00 PC=0204 Cycles=4
> clear $0204
> list
No breakpoints set.
```

The simulator stopped before the `LDY #$20` at `$0204`. Y is still `$00`. Up to 16
breakpoints can be active simultaneously.

### Register and Flag Modification

**`set <reg> <val>`** — set any register:

```
> set A $77
Register A set to $77
> set PC $0210
```

**`flag <flag> <0|1>`** — set a single flag:

```
> flag N 1
Flag N set to 1 (P=$80)
> flag C 0
Flag C set to 0 (P=$80)
> regs
REGS A=77 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=80 PC=0200 Cycles=0
```

**`jump <addr>`** — redirect PC without changing any other register.

### Memory Modification

**`write <addr> <val>`** — write a single byte:

```
> write $0210 $42
> mem $0210 4

0210: 42 00 00 00
```

**`bload "file" <addr>`** — load a raw binary file into memory at `addr`:

```
> bload "tests/data/three_bytes.bin" $0200
Loaded 3 bytes at $0200
> mem $0200 4

0200: 42 AB FF 00
```

### Inline Assembly and Disassembly

**`asm [addr]`** — enter the inline assembler at `addr` (default: current PC). Type one
instruction per line; exit with `.` alone on a line:

```
> asm
Assembling from $0200  (enter '.' on a blank line to finish)
$0200> LDA #$FF
$0202> STX $10
$0204> .
Assembly done.  End address: $0204
```

Verify with disasm:

```
> disasm $0200 5
$0200: A9 FF              LDA    #$FF
$0202: 86 10              STX    $10
$0204: 00                 BRK
$0205: 00                 BRK
$0206: 00                 BRK
```

The `asm` command understands the same syntax as the file-based assembler: labels, all
literal formats, pseudo-ops including `.org` and `.byte`.

**`processor <type>`** — switch processor variant without leaving the monitor:

```
> processor 45gs02
```

### Processor Reference Inside the Monitor

**`info <mnemonic>`** — show addressing modes and cycle counts:

```
> info STZ
Opcode Information for STZ:

Mode            Byte       Length     Cycles
---------------------------------------------------
ABS             $9C        3          4
ABX             $9E        3          5
ZP              $64        2          3
ZPX             $74        2          4
```

**`processors`** — list all variants.

### A Complete Debug Session

This session loads a program, disassembles it, sets a breakpoint, runs to it, modifies a
register, steps through the rest, and inspects the result.

```
$ ./sim6502 -I tests/6502_basic.asm

> disasm
$0200: A9 42              LDA    #$42
$0202: A2 10              LDX    #$10
$0204: A0 20              LDY    #$20
$0206: 00                 BRK

> break $0204
> run
STOP at $0204

> regs
REGS A=42 X=10 Y=00 S=FF P=00 PC=0204 Cycles=4

> set A $FF
Register A set to $FF

> step
STOP $0206

> regs
REGS A=FF X=10 Y=20 S=FF P=00 PC=0206 Cycles=6

> mem $0200 8

0200: A9 42 A2 10 A0 20 00 00

> quit
```

## Section 7 — Symbol Tables and TRAP Simulation

### Why Symbol Tables?

Without symbol tables, disassembly at `$FFD2` is just a hex address. With the C64 preset,
it becomes `CHROUT`. Beyond readability, **TRAP symbols** allow the simulator to intercept
calls to ROM routines it cannot actually execute, print the arguments, and simulate the
return — letting you test programs that call Kernal routines without implementing the Kernal.

### Built-in Presets

Load with `--preset <name>`. All four are in the `symbols/` directory.

**`c64`** — Commodore 64:
- VIC-II video registers (`$D000–$D0FF`)
- SID sound registers (`$D400–$D41F`)
- CIA 1 and CIA 2 (`$DC00`, `$DD00`)
- Full Kernal jump table (`$FF81–$FFF3`): CHROUT, GETIN, LOAD, SAVE, OPEN, CLOSE, and
  more — all defined as TRAP

**`c128`** — Commodore 128:
- Everything from c64 plus
- MMU (memory management unit) at `$FF00–$FF04`
- VDC (80-column video) registers

**`mega65`** — MEGA65:
- Hypervisor entry points and vectors
- HyperRAM control registers
- 45GS02-specific I/O ports

**`x16`** — Commander X16:
- VERA video chip
- PSG (programmable sound generator)
- SPI, RTC, GPIO
- X16 Kernal routines

### How TRAP Works

When the CPU executes `JSR` to an address that has a TRAP symbol:

1. The simulator intercepts before calling any handler code
2. It prints the register state at the moment of the call
3. It simulates an `RTS` (pops the return address from the stack, restores PC)
4. It charges 6 cycles

No real code runs at the TRAP address. The program continues from the instruction after the
`JSR` as if the ROM routine returned normally.

Example — calling CHROUT with the C64 preset:

```asm
; tests/trap_kernal.asm
LDA #$41    ; 'A'
JSR $FFD2   ; CHROUT
BRK
```

```
$ ./sim6502 --preset c64 tests/trap_kernal.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...
[TRAP] CHROUT               $FFD2  A=41 X=00 Y=00 S=FD P=00  ; Output char A to current channel

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=41 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0205
```

The TRAP line shows the register state at the moment the JSR was taken. S is `$FD` because
JSR pushed two bytes (the return address). After the simulated RTS, S returns to `$FF`.

If you reach a TRAP address via `JMP` or fall-through instead of `JSR`, the simulator cannot
simulate RTS (there is no return address on the stack) and halts with a diagnostic.

### Custom Symbol Files

**File format** — one symbol per line:

```
; Comment lines start with semicolon
; FORMAT: ADDRESS  NAME  TYPE  [COMMENT]

0200  main        LABEL  Program entry point
0210  loop        LABEL  Main loop
0000  ptr_lo      VAR    16-bit pointer, low byte
0001  ptr_hi      VAR    16-bit pointer, high byte
d020  border      IO     VIC border color register
ffd2  MYOUT       TRAP   Custom output routine
```

**The seven symbol types:**

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| LABEL | Code or data label |
| VAR | Mutable variable in RAM |
| CONST | Read-only constant |
| FUNC | Subroutine entry point |
| IO | Memory-mapped I/O register |
| REGION | Named range of memory |
| TRAP | Intercept point; JSR here is simulated |

Load with `--symbols my.sym`. Combine with a preset:

```
$ ./sim6502 --preset c64 --symbols my.sym program.asm
```

Verify the file loaded with `--show-symbols`.

## Section 8 — Interrupts

### Three Interrupt Types

The 6502 has three interrupt mechanisms:

**BRK** (software interrupt): triggered by the `BRK` instruction. Sets the B flag in P
before pushing it. Uses the IRQ/BRK vector at `$FFFE`/`$FFFF`. In this simulator, BRK
halts execution rather than jumping through the vector.

**IRQ** (maskable hardware interrupt): can only be taken when the I flag is clear (I=0,
set by `CLI`; I=1 set by `SEI` blocks it). The CPU pushes PC (high, then low) and P (with
B=0) to the stack, sets I=1, then jumps via the vector at `$FFFE`/`$FFFF`.

**NMI** (non-maskable interrupt): always taken, regardless of the I flag. Uses the vector
at `$FFFA`/`$FFFB`. The push sequence is the same as IRQ.

### Interrupt Vectors

| Vector | Address | Used by |
|--------|---------|---------|
| NMI | `$FFFA`/`$FFFB` | NMI |
| Reset | `$FFFC`/`$FFFD` | Power-on / reset |
| IRQ/BRK | `$FFFE`/`$FFFF` | IRQ and BRK |

Setting up vectors in assembly:

```asm
.org $FFFA
    .word nmi_handler   ; NMI vector
    .word $0200         ; reset vector (not used in simulator)
    .word irq_handler   ; IRQ/BRK vector
```

### Stack Behavior During Interrupt

When an IRQ or NMI is taken:

1. Push PC high byte (PC >> 8)
2. Push PC low byte (PC & $FF)
3. Push P (with B=0 for hardware interrupts)
4. Set I=1 (disable further IRQs)
5. Load PC from vector

Return with `RTI` which pulls P then PC (opposite order from how they were pushed). Note
that `RTS` only pulls PC — never use `RTS` to return from an interrupt handler.

### Command-Line Interrupt Injection

**`-i <CYCLES>`** — fire an IRQ after the CPU has executed that many cycles:

```
$ ./sim6502 -i 50 examples/interrupt_demo.asm
```

**`-n <CYCLES>`** — fire an NMI after that many cycles:

```
$ ./sim6502 -n 100 examples/interrupt_demo.asm
```

A minimal interrupt handler example:

```asm
.processor 6502

.org $0200          ; main program
    CLI             ; allow IRQs
    LDA #$00
    STA $0300       ; counter = 0
main_loop:
    INC $0300       ; increment counter
    JMP main_loop

.org $FE00          ; IRQ handler
irq_handler:
    PHA             ; save A
    LDA $0300       ; read counter
    STA $0301       ; save it somewhere
    PLA             ; restore A
    RTI             ; return from interrupt

.org $FFFE
    .word irq_handler
```

Run with an IRQ fired at cycle 20:

```
$ ./sim6502 -i 20 myprogram.asm
```

---

## Section 9 — Execution Tracing and Cycle Counting

### Enabling the Trace

Trace to stdout (note: check exact flag usage with `--help` — the flag may need to appear
before the filename):

```
$ ./sim6502 --trace tests/6502_adc.asm
```

The trace header and one line per instruction will appear before the final register dump.
For programs with many instructions, redirect to a file for later analysis.

### Trace Output Format

Each row in the trace corresponds to one executed instruction and shows the CPU state
*after* that instruction completes:

```
=== Execution Trace ===
PC   | OP  | Addr     | A  X  Y  S  P | Cycles
$0200: CLC (IMP)  A=00 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=00  Cycles: 2
$0201: LDA #$01 (IMM)  A=01 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=00  Cycles: 4
$0203: ADC #$02 (IMM)  A=03 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=00  Cycles: 6
$0205: BRK (IMP)  A=03 X=00 Y=00 S=FF P=10  Cycles: 13
```

Reading a trace line: `$0201: LDA #$01 (IMM)` — the instruction at PC=$0201 is LDA with
immediate mode; after executing, A=$01, cycles accumulated so far = 4.

### Cycle Accounting

Every opcode in the simulator carries four cycle counts — one for each processor variant
(6502 / 65C02 / 65CE02 / 45GS02). The active variant's count is used. You can verify cycle
counts against published datasheets or the `--info` output.

The `examples/cycle_demo.asm` illustrates the basic counts:

```asm
.processor 6502
; LDA #$10 = 2 cycles (IMM)
; ADC #$20 = 2 cycles (IMM)
; STA $1000 = 4 cycles (ABS)
LDA #$10
ADC #$20
STA $1000
```

Running with a trace would show the cumulative cycle count reaching 8 after STA.

**Additional cycle penalties** (not always simulated in detail, but real on hardware):
- Absolute,X or Absolute,Y crosses a page boundary: +1 cycle
- Branch taken: +1 cycle; branch taken and crosses page boundary: +2 cycles
- Read-modify-write instructions (INC, ROR, etc.) on 65C02: behavior changed from NMOS

The default cycle limit is 100,000. If your program hits this, the simulator halts with a
cycle-limit message. Design long-running programs with BRK as a termination condition, or
restructure the loop so BRK is reachable.

### Memory Write Statistics

`-s` prints a summary of every byte written during execution:

```
$ ./sim6502 -s tests/6502_basic.asm
...
```

For programs with stores this shows the address, last value written, and write count. This
is useful for verifying that a zero-page variable is not accidentally clobbered by two
different code paths, or for understanding the write pattern of a copy routine.

---

## Section 10 — The Test System

### Test File Format

Every test file begins with a `; EXPECT:` comment on **line 1**:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=10 Y=20 S=FF PC=0206
```

The values are hexadecimal. The register names must match exactly (uppercase). You can list
only the registers you care about; unlisted registers are not checked.

An optional `; PROCESSOR:` comment selects the CPU variant. Without it, the default is
`6502`:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=0A X=00 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=022C
; PROCESSOR: 45gs02
```

An optional `; FLAGS:` comment passes additional command-line flags to the runner:

```asm
; EXPECT: A=42 X=10 Y=00 Z=00 B=00 S=FF PC=2011
; PROCESSOR: 45gs02
; FLAGS: -a 0x2000
```

### The Test Runner

`make test` invokes `tools/run_tests.py`, which:

1. Finds all `.asm` files in `tests/`
2. For each file, runs `./sim6502 [FLAGS from ; FLAGS:] -p [PROCESSOR] file.asm`
3. Parses the `Registers:` line from stdout
4. Compares each value in the EXPECT comment against the parsed output
5. Reports PASS or FAIL

A passing run:

```
Running test: tests/6502_basic.asm... PASS
Running test: tests/45gs02_quad.asm... PASS
...
Summary: 37 passed, 0 failed.
```

A failure shows the expected vs. actual values:

```
Running test: tests/my_new_test.asm... FAIL
  Expected: A=42, got A=00
```

### Writing a New Test

**Step 1**: Write the program and determine what the register state should be after BRK.

**Step 2**: Run the file manually to capture the actual output:

```
$ ./sim6502 -p 65c02 my_test.asm
Starting execution at 0x0200...

Execution Finished.
Registers: A=00 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0209
```

**Step 3**: Add `; EXPECT:` and `; PROCESSOR:` as line 1 (and 2 if needed):

```asm
; EXPECT: A=00 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0209
; PROCESSOR: 65c02
.processor 65c02
STZ $0300    ; store zero at $0300
BRK
```

**Step 4**: Move the file to `tests/`, then run `make test` to confirm it passes.

## Section 11 — The MCP Plugin

### What MCP Is

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard interface that lets a language model call
external tools as structured function calls. The `plugin-gemini/server.js` file is a Node.js
MCP server that exposes the 6502 simulator to any MCP-capable client, including Claude Code.

The LLM can assemble programs, run them, inspect CPU state, set breakpoints, and iterate —
all through structured API calls without touching a shell.

### Setup

Build the simulator first (required — the plugin spawns `./sim6502`):

```
make
```

Install Node.js dependencies:

```
cd plugin-gemini
npm install
```

Register with Claude Code using the MCP add command:

```
claude mcp add 6502-simulator node /full/path/to/plugin-gemini/server.js
```

Alternatively, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "6502-simulator": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/6502-simulator/plugin-gemini/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### The 15 Available Tools

#### Program Lifecycle

**`load_program`** — assembles a string of source code and loads it into the simulator:
```
load_program(code: "LDA #$42\nBRK")
```

**`run_program`** — runs until BRK, STP, or a breakpoint. Returns register state.

**`reset_cpu`** — resets CPU to its initial state at the start address.

#### Stepping

**`step_instruction`** — executes `count` instructions (default 1) and returns the CPU
state after each step.

#### Register and Memory Access

**`read_registers`** — returns all register values as a structured object.

**`read_memory`** — hex dump starting at `address` for `length` bytes (default 16):
```
read_memory(address: 0x0300, length: 16)
```

**`write_memory`** — writes one byte:
```
write_memory(address: 0x0210, value: 0x42)
```

#### Assembly and Disassembly

**`assemble`** — inline-assemble a string into memory at `address` (default: current PC):
```
assemble(code: "LDA #$FF\nSTA $10", address: 0x0200)
```

**`disassemble`** — disassemble `count` instructions starting at `address` (defaults: PC, 15).

#### Breakpoints

**`set_breakpoint`** / **`clear_breakpoint`** / **`list_breakpoints`** — manage the
breakpoint list. Same 16-breakpoint limit as the command-line interface.

#### CPU Information

**`list_processors`** — returns the list of all processor variants.

**`set_processor`** — switches the active processor:
```
set_processor(type: "45gs02")
```

**`get_opcode_info`** — returns addressing modes and cycle counts for a mnemonic:
```
get_opcode_info(mnemonic: "LDA")
```

### A Typical LLM-Driven Session

With the MCP server registered, an LLM session might look like this (paraphrased — the LLM
calls tools, not the user):

1. User asks Claude to write a byte-copy routine for the 6502
2. Claude drafts the assembly, then calls `load_program` with the source
3. Claude calls `run_program` and receives the register state
4. Registers look wrong — Claude calls `set_breakpoint` on the inner loop, then `run_program`
   again
5. Simulator halts at the breakpoint; Claude calls `read_registers` and `read_memory` to
   inspect the source and destination buffers
6. Claude identifies the bug, calls `assemble` with the corrected inner loop, `reset_cpu`,
   and `run_program` again
7. This time registers match the expected values; Claude reports success to the user

The key advantage is that Claude can iterate on 6502 code without leaving the conversation.
No terminal required on the user's side.

## Appendix A — Addressing Mode Deep Dive

This appendix shows, for each addressing mode, how the effective address is computed. All
addresses are 16-bit unsigned values.

### Implied (IMP)

No operand. The instruction acts on a fixed register or has no address (NOP, RTS, CLC, etc.).

```
NOP        ; opcode only, 1 byte
```

### Immediate (IMM)

The operand *is* the data — no memory access for the value.

```
LDA #$42   ; opcode $A9, operand $42 — A := $42
```

### Zero Page (ZP)

One-byte address (always in page 0, `$0000–$00FF`).

```
effective_address = operand_byte
LDA $10    ; reads from address $0010
```

### Zero Page, X (ZPX)

Zero-page base plus X. The sum wraps within page 0 (no carry into the high byte).

```
effective_address = (operand_byte + X) & $FF
LDA $10,X  ; X=$05 → reads from $0015
```

### Zero Page, Y (ZPY)

Same as ZPX but with Y. Only a few instructions use this mode (LDX, STX).

### Absolute (ABS)

Full 16-bit address in the instruction.

```
effective_address = operand_word (lo byte first, then hi byte)
LDA $1234  ; opcode, lo=$34, hi=$12 — reads from $1234
```

### Absolute, X (ABX) and Absolute, Y (ABY)

Full 16-bit base plus index. If the result crosses a page boundary, most read instructions
add one cycle on real hardware (the simulator tracks but does not always penalize this).

```
effective_address = operand_word + X  (or Y)
LDA $1200,X  ; X=$05 → reads from $1205
```

### Indirect (IND)

The instruction holds a 16-bit pointer address. The CPU reads two bytes from that address
to form the effective address. Used only with JMP.

```
pointer_addr = operand_word
effective_address = mem[pointer_addr] | (mem[pointer_addr+1] << 8)
JMP ($1234)  ; reads $1234/$1235, jumps there
```

Note: on the NMOS 6502, if pointer_addr = `$10FF`, the high byte is read from `$1000`
(page wrap bug). The 65C02 fixes this.

### Indexed Indirect X (INX) — `(zp,X)`

Zero-page base plus X forms a pointer address. The CPU reads two bytes from that zero-page
address to get the effective address.

```
pointer_addr = (operand_byte + X) & $FF
effective_address = mem[pointer_addr] | (mem[pointer_addr+1] << 8)
LDA ($10,X)  ; X=$02 → pointer at $12/$13 → effective address from memory
```

### Indirect Indexed Y (INY) — `(zp),Y`

The zero-page byte holds a pointer address directly. The CPU adds Y to the value read from
that pointer.

```
pointer_addr = operand_byte
base = mem[pointer_addr] | (mem[pointer_addr+1] << 8)
effective_address = base + Y
LDA ($10),Y  ; reads pointer from $10/$11, adds Y
```

### Relative (REL)

Used by all branch instructions. The operand is a signed 8-bit offset from the byte after
the branch instruction.

```
effective_address = PC + 2 + signed_offset
BEQ +$05   ; if branch at $0200: target = $0202 + $05 = $0207
BEQ -$06   ; target = $0202 + (-$06) = $01FC
```

The assembler computes this automatically when you write `BEQ label`.

### ZP Indirect — `(zp)` (65C02+)

Like `(zp,X)` but without X. A zero-page byte holds the pointer; CPU reads from there.

```
pointer_addr = operand_byte
effective_address = mem[pointer_addr] | (mem[pointer_addr+1] << 8)
LDA ($10)   ; reads pointer from $10/$11
```

### ZP Indirect Z — `(zp),Z` (65CE02/45GS02)

The Z register plays the role Y plays in `(zp),Y`.

```
base = mem[operand_byte] | (mem[operand_byte+1] << 8)
effective_address = base + Z
LDA ($10),Z  ; reads pointer from $10/$11, adds Z
```

### Flat Indirect — `[$zp]` (45GS02 only)

The zero page holds a **4-byte** little-endian 28-bit physical address. The CPU accesses
physical memory directly, bypassing MAP translation.

```
physical_addr = mem[$zp] | (mem[$zp+1]<<8) | (mem[$zp+2]<<16) | (mem[$zp+3]<<24)
LDA [$10]    ; reads 4-byte pointer from $10–$13, accesses that physical address
```

### Flat Indirect Z — `[$zp],Z` (45GS02 only)

Same as flat indirect but adds Z to the physical address.

```
base_phys = mem[$zp] | ... | (mem[$zp+3]<<24)
physical_addr = base_phys + Z
LDA [$10],Z
```

## Appendix B — Flag Behavior Reference

### N — Negative (bit 7)

Set when bit 7 of the result is 1. Cleared when bit 7 is 0.

Affected by: LDA, LDX, LDY, STA (via compare), ADC, SBC, AND, ORA, EOR, INC, DEC, INX,
DEX, INY, DEY, ASL, LSR, ROL, ROR, CMP, CPX, CPY, PLP, RTI, BIT (bit 7 of memory operand
for non-immediate BIT), TAX, TAY, TXA, TYA, TSX.

Not affected by: branch instructions, flag-manipulation instructions, stack pointer changes.

### V — Overflow (bit 6)

Set when signed arithmetic produces a result outside the range −128 to +127.

Rule of thumb: V is set when two positive numbers add to a negative result, or two negative
numbers add to a positive result. Equivalently: carry into bit 7 ≠ carry out of bit 7.

Set by: ADC (when signed overflow occurs), SBC (when signed underflow occurs), BIT (copies
bit 6 of the memory operand, for non-immediate modes).

Cleared by: CLV; ADC/SBC when no overflow; BIT (when memory bit 6 = 0).

### U / E — Unused / Emulation (bit 5)

On the 6502 and 65C02: always reads as 1. It has no purpose.

On the 65CE02 and 45GS02: this bit is the E (Emulation) flag. E=1 means emulation mode
(8-bit stack on page 1); E=0 means extended mode (16-bit stack). Set with `SEE`, cleared
with `CLE`.

### B — Break (bit 4)

Not a real register bit in the hardware sense — it exists only on the stack. When the CPU
pushes P (during BRK or PHP), bit 4 is set to 1. When the CPU pushes P during an IRQ or
NMI, bit 4 is set to 0. This is how an IRQ handler can distinguish BRK from a hardware
interrupt.

RTI restores P from the stack, so B is whatever value was on the stack.

### D — Decimal (bit 3)

When set, ADC and SBC interpret A and the operand as packed BCD. Set with `SED`, cleared
with `CLD`.

The NMOS 6502 leaves the N, V, and Z flags in an undefined state after BCD operations. The
65C02 and later variants define them fully. The simulator models the CMOS behavior for all
variants.

### I — IRQ Disable (bit 2)

When I=1, hardware IRQs are ignored. NMI is not affected by I.

Set by: SEI; automatically set when any interrupt (IRQ or NMI) is taken (to prevent
re-entry).

Cleared by: CLI; RTI (restores from the stack, which may have I=0).

### Z — Zero (bit 1)

Set when the result is exactly zero. Cleared when the result is non-zero.

Affected by the same instructions as N.

Also set by BIT when `A AND memory == 0`; cleared when `A AND memory != 0`.

### C — Carry (bit 0)

For addition (ADC): set when the 8-bit sum overflows (unsigned carry out of bit 7).

For subtraction (SBC): set when no borrow is needed (i.e., `A >= operand` unsigned).

For shifts: ASL sets C to the old bit 7; LSR sets C to the old bit 0; ROL/ROR rotate through
C. Quad shifts behave the same but operate on the 32-bit value.

Set by: SEC, ADC (unsigned overflow), carry from shifts, CMP/CPX/CPY when A ≥ operand.

Cleared by: CLC, SBC (unsigned underflow), carry from shifts.

## Appendix C — Building Custom Opcode Extensions

If you want to add new instructions to the simulator — for a custom processor variant or
experimental extensions — this appendix describes the exact structure to follow.

### The `opcode_handler_t` Struct

Defined in `src/opcodes.h`:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char *mnemonic;      // "LDA", "STQ", etc.
    int mode;                  // MODE_IMMEDIATE, MODE_ZP, etc. (from cpu.h)
    void (*handler)(cpu_t *, memory_t *, uint16_t); // execution function
    int cycles_6502;
    int cycles_65c02;
    int cycles_65ce02;
    int cycles_45gs02;
    uint8_t opcode;            // the byte value, e.g. 0xA9
} opcode_handler_t;
```

An entry in an opcode table:

```c
{ "LDA", MODE_IMMEDIATE, op_lda_imm, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0xA9 }
```

### Writing a Handler Function

A handler receives the CPU state, memory, and the **effective address** (already computed by
the dispatcher based on the addressing mode). It modifies CPU registers and calls helper
macros for flags.

```c
static void op_lda_imm(cpu_t *cpu, memory_t *mem, uint16_t addr) {
    cpu->a = mem->mem[addr];        // addr is the address of the operand byte
    update_nz(cpu, cpu->a);         // sets N and Z based on cpu->a
}
```

Key helpers from `cpu.h`:

```c
update_nz(cpu, value)        // update N and Z from value
set_flag(cpu, FLAG_C, expr)  // set or clear C based on boolean expr
get_flag(cpu, FLAG_C)        // read a flag (returns 0 or 1)
```

Flag constants: `FLAG_N`, `FLAG_V`, `FLAG_B`, `FLAG_D`, `FLAG_I`, `FLAG_Z`, `FLAG_C`,
`FLAG_E`.

Mode constants: `MODE_IMPLIED`, `MODE_IMMEDIATE`, `MODE_ZP`, `MODE_ZP_X`, `MODE_ZP_Y`,
`MODE_ABSOLUTE`, `MODE_ABSOLUTE_X`, `MODE_ABSOLUTE_Y`, `MODE_INDIRECT`, `MODE_INDIRECT_X`,
`MODE_INDIRECT_Y`, `MODE_RELATIVE`, `MODE_ZP_INDIRECT`, `MODE_ZP_INDIRECT_Z`,
`MODE_RELATIVE_LONG`, `MODE_ABS_INDIRECT_Y`, `MODE_SP_INDIRECT_Y`,
`MODE_ABS_INDIRECT_X`, `MODE_IMMEDIATE_WORD`, `MODE_ZP_INDIRECT_FLAT`,
`MODE_ZP_INDIRECT_Z_FLAT`.

### Adding the Entry to a Table

Each processor file exports an array ending with a sentinel (`{ NULL, 0, NULL, 0,0,0,0, 0 }`).
Add your new entry before the sentinel:

```c
opcode_handler_t opcodes_6502[] = {
    ...existing entries...
    { "MYO", MODE_IMMEDIATE, op_myo_imm, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0xEB },
    { NULL, 0, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }
};
```

If the opcode byte collides with an existing entry, the first match wins — put more specific
entries first.

### The 45GS02 Quad Prefix

Quad instructions on the 45GS02 are prefixed with `$42 $42`. In `opcodes_45gs02.c`, the
dispatcher checks a `cpu->eom_prefix` counter that increments on each `NEG` (`$42`) and
resets after dispatching the prefixed instruction. If you add a quad instruction, follow the
existing pattern in `opcodes_45gs02.c` where opcode entries for the same base byte appear
twice — once without the prefix (the plain instruction) and once with prefix handling.

### Running `make test` After Changes

After adding an opcode, always run `make test` to check that no existing tests regressed.
Then add a new test in `tests/` following the format in Section 10.
