; EXPECT: A=42 X=00 Y=00 S=FF PC=0207
;
; Self-modifying code: overwrite the operand byte of a subsequent LDA instruction.
;
; Layout at $0200:
;   $0200-$0201  LDA #$42       ; opcode $A9, operand $42
;   $0202-$0204  STA $0206      ; write $42 to the operand of the LDA #$FF below
;   $0205-$0206  LDA #$FF       ; operand byte at $0206 will be overwritten → LDA #$42
;   $0207        BRK
;
; If execution reads from mem[] (SMC works), A ends up $42.
; If execution reads from a stale ROM copy,  A ends up $FF.

        LDA #$42
        STA $0206
        LDA #$FF
        BRK
