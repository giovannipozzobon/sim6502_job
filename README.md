## Features

### Processor Variants

| Flag | Processor | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `6502` | NMOS 6502 | Standard documented opcodes |
| `6502-undoc` | NMOS 6502 | Includes undocumented/illegal opcodes |
| `65c02` | CMOS 65C02 | WDC extensions (BIT imm, STZ, TRB, TSB, …) |
| `65ce02` | CSG 65CE02 | Adds Z register, B register, 16-bit branches, word ops |
| `45gs02` | MEGA65 45GS02 | Full 32-bit quad instructions, MAP translation, 28-bit flat addressing |

### 45GS02 Advanced Features

- **Quad Instructions**: 32-bit operations (LDQ, STQ, ADDQ, etc.) via the `$42 $42` prefix.
- **Flat Addressing**: Access up to 256MB of memory using 28-bit physical addresses.
- **MAP Translation**: 8KB virtual memory blocks can be mapped to any 20-bit physical offset.
- **Extended Registers**: 8-bit Z and B registers, and a 16-bit Stack Pointer (SP).
- **New Addressing Modes**: Stack-relative indirect indexed `(d,SP),Y` and flat indirect `[d]` or `[d],Z`.

### Assembler

The simulator includes an integrated assembler that runs before execution:

- **Forward label references** resolved in the second pass.
- **All literal formats**: `$FF` hex, `%10101010` binary, `'A'` character, `123` decimal.
- **Detailed Pseudo-ops**: `.processor`, `.org`, `.byte`, `.word`, `.text`, `.align`, `.bin`.

### Debugger / Monitor

- **History / Time Machine**: Step backwards and forwards through execution history. The simulator records register states and memory deltas.
- **Up to 16 simultaneous breakpoints**: Supports complex conditions (e.g., `PC == $1234 && A == $00 && .Z == 1`).
- **Execution trace**: Detailed logs of every instruction, address, register state, and cycle count.
- **Interactive monitor**: Full-featured CLI for inspecting/modifying registers and memory.
- **ROM TRAP intercept**: Simulate Kernal/ROM calls (e.g., CHROUT) without loading real ROM files.
- **Speed throttle**: Configurable run-speed limiter; `1.0` = C64 PAL clock (~985 kHz), `0` = unlimited.

### VIC-II Support (C64 / C128 / MEGA65)

- **Software rasteriser**: All display modes rendered — Standard Char, Multicolour Char, Extended Colour (ECM), Standard Bitmap, Multicolour Bitmap.
- **Sprite rendering**: All 8 hardware sprites with X/Y expansion, multicolour, X-MSB, and correct priority.
- **CLI commands**: `vic2.info`, `vic2.regs`, `vic2.sprites`, `vic2.savescreen`, `vic2.savebitmap`.
- **MCP tools**: `vic2_info`, `vic2_regs`, `vic2_sprites`, `vic2_savescreen`, `vic2_savebitmap`.

### Memory Model

- **Sparse 28-bit Space**: Supports up to 256MB of physical memory, allocated on demand in 4KB pages.
- **MAP Translation**: Full implementation of the C65/MEGA65 MAP register logic for virtual-to-physical address mapping.
- **Write Logging**: Tracks memory writes for history undo/redo and GUI highlighting.

---

## Graphical Debugger (GUI)

The simulator includes a comprehensive IDE-style debugger built with **Dear ImGui**. It provides a real-time, multi-pane view of the processor state and allows for interactive development.

### Key GUI Panes

- **Register Display**: Live view of all CPU registers (A, X, Y, Z, B, SP, PC) and status flags with diff highlighting.
- **Disassembly View**: Real-time disassembly with breakpoint toggles, cycle counts, and symbol integration.
- **Memory View**: Hex + ASCII dump with "follow PC/SP" modes and highlighting of last-written bytes.
- **CLI Console**: A full-featured interactive terminal mirroring the CLI monitor mode with command history.
- **Source Viewer**: View the original assembly source code alongside the disassembly.
- **Profiler / Heatmap**: Visualise execution frequency and cycle consumption across the entire 64KB memory map.
- **Watch List**: Monitor specific memory addresses and their values in real-time.
- **Instruction Reference**: Built-in searchable database of all opcodes, addressing modes, and cycle counts for the active processor.
- **Symbol Browser**: Search and inspect all loaded labels, variables, and constants.
- **Stack Inspector**: Human-readable view of the hardware stack and annotated frames.
- **Trace Log**: Rolling ring-buffer of recently executed instructions and CPU states.
- **VIC-II Viewer**: Three panes — Screen (live 384×272 rendered frame with all modes and sprites), Sprites (per-sprite thumbnail grid), and Registers (decoded D011–D01A, video addresses, colour swatches).
- **Speed Throttle**: Run menu slider limits execution to a configurable multiple of the C64 PAL clock; setting persists across sessions via ImGui INI.

  -l, --list               List all available processor types

EXECUTION
  -a, --address <ADDR>     Override start address (hex $xxxx, or a label name)

DEBUGGING
  -I, --interactive        Enter interactive monitor (no source file required)
  -b, --break <ADDR>       Set a breakpoint (hex address, e.g. 0x1000 or $1000; can also take an optional condition)

---

## Assembler Syntax

### Equates

```asm
SCREEN  = $0400     ; define a named constant
COLOUR  = $D800
```

`NAME = VALUE` equates are resolved before instructions are assembled. The value can be any literal format.

### Local Labels

Labels starting with `.` are local and are intended for use within a single routine:

```asm
mul_loop:
    LSR FACTOR_B
    BCC .skip
    ADC FACTOR_A
.skip:
    DEX
    BNE mul_loop
```

Local labels do not need to be unique across the file.

### Literal Formats

```asm
LDA #$FF        ; hex
LDA #%11111111  ; binary
LDA #'A'        ; character (ASCII 65)
LDA #255        ; decimal
```

All four formats work everywhere a value is expected: immediate operands, addresses, and pseudo-op arguments.

### Pseudo-ops

#### `.processor <variant>`
Select the processor before assembly begins. This may appear anywhere in the file and takes effect immediately.
```asm
.processor 45gs02
```
Accepted values: `6502`, `6502 undoc`, `65c02`, `65ce02`, `45gs02`.

#### `.org <addr>`
Set the program counter to an absolute address for following code or data.
```asm
.org $C000
```

#### `.byte <val>[, <val>…]`
Emit one or more bytes. Accepts all literal formats and label names (emits the low byte of the label address).
```asm
.byte $48, 'e', 108, %01101100, 'o'   ; "Hello"
```

#### `.word <val>[, <val>…]`
Emit 16-bit little-endian words. Useful for vectors and jump tables.
```asm
vectors:
    .word reset_handler, irq_handler
```

#### `.text "string"`
Emit raw string bytes. No implicit null terminator is added. Supports escape sequences `\n \r \t \0 \\ \"`.
```asm
message: .text "Hello, World!\n"
```

#### `.align <n>`
Advance the PC to the next multiple of `n`, padding with zero bytes. Useful for page alignment.
```asm
.align 256      ; align to a page boundary
```

#### `.bin "filename"`
Include a raw binary file at the current PC. The file is read in both passes to ensure labels following the binary are correctly resolved.
```asm
sprite_data: .bin "assets/sprite.bin"
```

### Breakpoint Conditions

Breakpoints can be made conditional using standard assembler expression syntax. Supported operators (in order of precedence):
1. Parentheses: `( )`
2. Unary: `~` (bitwise NOT)
3. Shifts: `<<, >>`
4. Bitwise: `&` (AND), `^` (XOR), `|` (OR)
5. Comparisons: `==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`
6. Logical: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)

Example: `break $C000 (A & $40) != 0 && .Z == 1`

---

## Symbol Tables

### Preset Architectures

Load with `--preset <name>`: `c64`, `c128`, `mega65`, `x16`.

### TRAP Symbols

TRAPs simulate Kernal/ROM routines without requiring the actual ROM to be loaded. When a `JSR` to a TRAP address is encountered:
1. Register state is logged.
2. The routine is skipped (return address popped).
3. CPU cycles are updated (standard 6 cycle overhead).

---

## MCP Server

`mcp-server/server.js` is a Node.js MCP server that exposes the simulator to LLMs, allowing AI assistants to write, debug, and execute 6502 assembly code directly.

## Known Limitations

- **Assembler**: No macro support yet. Complex expressions in operands are not supported beyond single values and symbol references.
- **Cycle Counts**: While provided, counts may not be 100% cycle-accurate for all addressing modes and page-crossing penalties in all variants.
- **Decimal Mode**: BCD flag behavior matches correct arithmetic output but does not currently emulate NMOS-specific undefined N/V/Z flag quirks.
