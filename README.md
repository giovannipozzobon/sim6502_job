# 6502 Simulator

An assembler-based executor for 6502 and compatible processors, with an interactive monitor, symbol table support, a Dear ImGui-based graphical debugger, and an MCP server for LLM integration. Assembly is handled by the embedded [KickAssembler](https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/) (65CE02/45GS02 fork), enabling full macro support and rich diagnostic output.

For a full walkthrough of all features, see **[doc/tutorial.md](doc/tutorial.md)**.
For detailed information on the graphical debugger, see **[README-gui.md](README-gui.md)**.

## Features

### Processor Variants

| Flag | Processor | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `6502` | NMOS 6502 | Standard documented opcodes |
| `6502-undoc` | NMOS 6502 | Includes undocumented/illegal opcodes |
| `65c02` | CMOS 65C02 | WDC extensions (BIT imm, STZ, TRB, TSB, …) |
| `65ce02` | CSG 65CE02 | Adds Z register, B register, 16-bit branches, word ops |
| `45gs02` | MEGA65 45GS02 | Full 32-bit quad instructions, MAP translation, 28-bit flat addressing |

### 45GS02 Advanced Features

- **Quad Instructions**: 32-bit operations (LDQ, STQ, ADDQ, etc.) via the `$42 $42` prefix.
- **Flat Addressing**: Access up to 256MB of memory using 28-bit physical addresses.
- **MAP Translation**: 8KB virtual memory blocks can be mapped to any 20-bit physical offset.
- **Extended Registers**: 8-bit Z and B registers, and a 16-bit Stack Pointer (SP).
- **New Addressing Modes**: Stack-relative indirect indexed `(d,SP),Y` and flat indirect `[d]` or `[d],Z`.

### Assembler

Assembly is performed by **KickAssembler** (`tools/KickAss65CE02.jar`) — a 65CE02/45GS02-extended fork of the standard KickAssembler v5.24. Java 8+ is required.

Key syntax conventions:
- **Comments**: `//` single-line; `/* */` block.
- **Origin**: `* = $0200`
- **CPU selection**: `.cpu _45gs02`, `.cpu _65ce02`, `.cpu _65c02`, `.cpu _6502`
- **Mnemonics**: lowercase (`lda`, `sta`, `jsr`, …)
- **Pseudo-ops**: `.byte`, `.word`, `.text`, `.align`, `.fill`, `.import`; KickAssembler macros and functions are supported.
- **Simulator pseudo-ops**: Embedded in `//` comments so files assemble cleanly without the simulator; see [Simulator Pseudo-ops](#simulator-pseudo-ops) below.

When the simulator loads a `.asm` file with no corresponding `.prg`, it auto-assembles via KickAssembler and caches the result.

### Debugger / Monitor

- **History / Time Machine**: Step backwards and forwards through execution history. The simulator records register states and memory deltas.
- **Up to 16 simultaneous breakpoints**: Supports complex conditions (e.g., `PC == $1234 && A == $00 && .Z == 1`).
- **Execution trace**: Detailed logs of every instruction, address, register state, and cycle count.
- **Interactive monitor**: Full-featured CLI for inspecting/modifying registers and memory.
- **ROM TRAP intercept**: Simulate Kernal/ROM calls (e.g., CHROUT) without loading real ROM files.
- **Speed throttle**: Configurable run-speed limiter; `1.0` = C64 PAL clock (~985 kHz), `0` = unlimited.

### VIC-II Support (C64 / C128 / MEGA65)

- **Software rasteriser**: All display modes rendered — Standard Char, Multicolour Char, Extended Colour (ECM), Standard Bitmap, Multicolour Bitmap.
- **Sprite rendering**: All 8 hardware sprites with X/Y expansion, multicolour, X-MSB, and correct priority.
- **CLI commands**: `vic2.info`, `vic2.regs`, `vic2.sprites`, `vic2.savescreen`, `vic2.savebitmap`.
- **MCP tools**: `vic2_info`, `vic2_regs`, `vic2_sprites`, `vic2_savescreen`, `vic2_savebitmap`.

### Memory Model

- **Sparse 28-bit Space**: Supports up to 256MB of physical memory, allocated on demand in 4KB pages.
- **MAP Translation**: Full implementation of the C65/MEGA65 MAP register logic for virtual-to-physical address mapping.
- **Write Logging**: Tracks memory writes for history undo/redo and GUI highlighting.

---

## Project Scaffolding (Environments)

The simulator includes a template-based project scaffolding system to instantly bootstrap development environments.

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `env list` | List all available project templates (found in `templates/`). |
| `env create <id> <name> [dir] [VAR=VAL...]` | Materialize a new project from a template. Supports custom variable overrides. |

### Templates

Templates are defined as JSON files in the `templates/` directory. They define the directory structure, boilerplate assembly code, Makefiles, and default variables.

Built-in templates include:
- `6502-minimal`: Bare-bones 6502 setup.
- `c64-standard`: C64 setup with BASIC stub andKernal loop.
- `mega65-basic`: Standard 45GS02 structure with Makefile.
- `mega65-quad`: Focused on 32-bit quad operations and extended registers.

---

## Graphical Debugger (GUI)

The simulator includes a comprehensive IDE-style debugger built with **Dear ImGui**. It provides a real-time, multi-pane view of the processor state and allows for interactive development.

### Key GUI Panes

- **Register Display**: Live view of all CPU registers (A, X, Y, Z, B, SP, PC) and status flags with diff highlighting.
- **Disassembly View**: Real-time disassembly with breakpoint toggles, cycle counts, and symbol integration.
- **Memory View**: Hex + ASCII dump with "follow PC/SP" modes and highlighting of last-written bytes.
- **CLI Console**: A full-featured interactive terminal mirroring the CLI monitor mode with command history.
- **Source Viewer**: View the original assembly source code alongside the disassembly.
- **Profiler / Heatmap**: Visualise execution frequency and cycle consumption across the entire 64KB memory map.
- **Watch List**: Monitor specific memory addresses and their values in real-time.
- **Instruction Reference**: Built-in searchable database of all opcodes, addressing modes, and cycle counts for the active processor.
- **Symbol Browser**: Search and inspect all loaded labels, variables, and constants.
- **Stack Inspector**: Human-readable view of the hardware stack and annotated frames.
- **Trace Log**: Rolling ring-buffer of recently executed instructions and CPU states.
- **VIC-II Viewer**: Three panes — Screen (live 384×272 rendered frame with all modes and sprites), Sprites (per-sprite thumbnail grid), and Registers (decoded D011–D01A, video addresses, colour swatches).
- **Speed Throttle**: Run menu slider limits execution to a configurable multiple of the C64 PAL clock; setting persists across sessions via ImGui INI.

---

## Assembler Syntax

Source files use **KickAssembler** syntax (65CE02/45GS02 fork). Mnemonics must be **lowercase**.

### CPU Selection and Origin

```asm
.cpu _45gs02        // select processor (at top of file)
* = $0200           // set program counter origin
```

Accepted CPU identifiers: `_6502`, `_65c02`, `_65ce02`, `_45gs02`.

### Comments

```asm
lda #$42        // single-line comment
/* block
   comment */
```

### Equates

```asm
SCREEN  = $0400     // named constant
COLOUR  = $D800
```

### Labels

```asm
loop:               // global label
    dex
    bne loop
```

### Literal Formats

```asm
lda #$FF        // hex
lda #%11111111  // binary
lda #'A'        // character (ASCII 65)
lda #255        // decimal
```

### Pseudo-ops

#### `* = <addr>`
Set the program counter to an absolute address.
```asm
* = $C000
```

#### `.byte <val>[, <val>…]`
Emit one or more bytes. Accepts all literal formats and label names (emits the low byte of the label address).
```asm
.byte $48, $65, $6C, $6C, $6F   // "Hello"
```

#### `.word <val>[, <val>…]`
Emit 16-bit little-endian words. Useful for vectors and jump tables.
```asm
vectors:
    .word reset_handler, irq_handler
```

#### `.text "string"`
Emit raw string bytes with no null terminator.
```asm
message: .text "Hello, World!\n"
```

#### `.align <n>`
Advance the PC to the next multiple of `n`, padding with zero bytes.
```asm
.align $100     // page-align
```

### Simulator Pseudo-ops

Simulator pseudo-ops are embedded as `//` comments so that the `.asm` file can be assembled directly by KickAssembler without errors. When the simulator loads the file it preprocesses these lines into KickAssembler `.print` statements that emit the resolved address to stdout, which the simulator captures to register the pseudo-op at the correct run-time address.

#### `//.inspect "device"`
When execution reaches this address, the simulator displays state for the named device.
```asm
    sta $D401           // write note frequency hi byte
    //.inspect "SID #1" // show SID state at the next instruction
    lda #20
    jsr wait_frames
```

#### `//.trap "label"`
When a `JSR` targets this address, the simulator logs the call and simulates an immediate `RTS` (useful for intercepting Kernal/ROM calls without loading ROM).
```asm
CHROUT = $FFD2
    //.trap "CHROUT"
```

#### `.sym_add` companion files

For programs loaded directly as `.prg` or `.bin` (built by any assembler), a `.sym_add` file with the same base name can carry supplemental annotations. The simulator loads it automatically alongside `.sym` and `.list`.

A `.sym_add` file may contain **either or both** of the following formats on any line:

```
; KickAssembler symbol format
.label sid_freq_hi=$0222

; Simulator pseudo-op markers (same format emitted by KickAssembler stdout)
SIM_INSPECT:0222:SID #1
SIM_TRAP:FFD2:CHROUT
```

Produce a `.sym_add` from a KickAssembler build by redirecting stdout:
```bash
java -jar tools/KickAss65CE02.jar prog.asm -symbolfile -o prog.prg > prog.sym_add
```

This allows any external toolchain to annotate `.prg`/`.bin` files with `.inspect` and `.trap` metadata without requiring re-assembly through the simulator.

### Breakpoint Conditions

Breakpoints can be made conditional using standard assembler expression syntax. Supported operators (in order of precedence):
1. Parentheses: `( )`
2. Unary: `~` (bitwise NOT)
3. Shifts: `<<, >>`
4. Bitwise: `&` (AND), `^` (XOR), `|` (OR)
5. Comparisons: `==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`
6. Logical: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)

Example: `break $C000 (A & $40) != 0 && .Z == 1`

---

## Symbol Tables

### Preset Architectures

Load with `--preset <name>`: `c64`, `c128`, `mega65`, `x16`.

### Companion Files

When any program is loaded the simulator looks for side-files sharing the same base name:

| Extension | Contents | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `.sym` | KickAssembler symbol file | Labels and constants |
| `.list` | ACME-format listing | Source-to-address map |
| `.sym_add` | Supplemental annotations | Additional symbols **and/or** `SIM_INSPECT:`/`SIM_TRAP:` lines |

`.sym_add` is useful for `.prg`/`.bin` files produced outside the simulator — place it next to the binary and the simulator picks it up automatically on load.

### TRAP Symbols

TRAPs simulate Kernal/ROM routines without requiring the actual ROM to be loaded. When a `JSR` to a TRAP address is encountered:
1. Register state is logged.
2. The routine is skipped (return address popped).
3. CPU cycles are updated (standard 6 cycle overhead).

---

## Known Limitations

- **Assembler**: No macro support yet. Complex expressions in operands are not supported beyond single values and symbol references.
- **Cycle Counts**: While provided, counts may not be 100% cycle-accurate for all addressing modes and page-crossing penalties in all variants.
- **Decimal Mode**: BCD flag behavior matches correct arithmetic output but does not currently emulate NMOS-specific undefined N/V/Z flag quirks.
